# Emojize
This is a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the “emojized” version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.

## How to run: 
Make sure to run the command: pip install emoji

## My notes:
I am having a challange when it comes to iterating over external data. For example, my first approach to emojize task was collecting the whole file of emojis and their values to create my dictionary that I can iterate through when converting user inpunt  to corresponding emoji.
